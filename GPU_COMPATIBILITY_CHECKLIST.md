## Testing Recommendations

1. **Quick Test**: Run training with a small subset of data
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. **Verify GPU Usage**: Check that GPU device context is applied
   - Look for GPU detection messages in console output
   - Monitor GPU usage with nvidia-smi during training

3. **Validate Results**: Confirm model accuracy matches CPU version
   - Compare final test accuracies
   - Verify confusion matrices are identical

4. **Performance Baseline**: Measure training time improvements

## Installation Requirements

No new packages required - all functionality uses:
- TensorFlow 2.x (already in use)
- NumPy (already in use)
- SciPy (already in use)
- scikit-learn (already in use)
- Matplotlib (already in use)

## Summary

✅ All scripts in `src/` directory and `train.py` are now GPU-compatible
✅ Zero changes to logic or pipelines
✅ Automatic GPU detection and fallback
✅ Complete backward compatibility maintained
✅ Ready for immediate use on GPU hardware
