# GPU Compatibility Upgrade Summary

## Overview
All scripts in the `src/` directory and `train.py` have been modified to support GPU acceleration while maintaining the original logic, pipelines, and functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. **train.py** - GPU Configuration and Training
**GPU Additions:**
- Added GPU device detection and memory growth configuration at startup
- Wraps training loop with GPU device context: `with tf.device('/GPU:0' if gpus else '/CPU:0')`
- Automatically falls back to CPU if no GPU is available
- Logs GPU availability to console

**Key Features:**
- Sets `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth()` to prevent TensorFlow from allocating all GPU memory at once
- Graceful fallback to CPU if GPU not available
- No changes to LOPO cross-validation logic or training pipeline

### 2. **src/models/cnn_lstm.py** - GPU Model Building
**GPU Additions:**
- Added GPU device detection in both model creation functions
- Wrapped model construction with `with tf.device('/GPU:0' if gpus else '/CPU:0')`
- Applies to both `create_cnn_lstm_model()` and `create_lightweight_cnn_lstm()`

**Key Features:**
- Model layers (Conv2D, LSTM, Dense) are now built on GPU
- Compilation happens on GPU
- Maintains all original architecture and layer specifications

### 3. **src/data/loader.py** - GPU-Ready Data Loading
**GPU Additions:**
- Added TensorFlow import
- Added new `create_gpu_dataset()` function for GPU-optimized data batching
- Implements automatic batching, shuffling, and prefetching with `tf.data.AUTOTUNE`

**Key Features:**
- Existing data loading functions remain unchanged
- New function available for optional GPU-optimized dataset creation
- Handles automatic buffer management for GPU efficiency

### 4. **src/data/preprocessing.py** - GPU-Ready Preprocessing
**GPU Additions:**
- Added TensorFlow import for future GPU tensor operations

**Key Features:**
- All preprocessing logic remains NumPy-based and CPU-optimized
- Maintains complete compatibility with existing data pipeline
- No changes to preprocessing algorithms or normalization methods

### 5. **src/models/utils.py** - GPU-Aware Evaluation
**GPU Additions:**
- Wrapped prediction/evaluation in `evaluate_model()` with GPU device context
- GPU device context for model prediction operations

**Key Features:**
- Predictions now run on GPU when available
- Maintains all existing functionality for model saving, loading, and callbacks
- Classification metrics computed on CPU (as required by sklearn)

### 6. **src/visualization/plotter.py** - GPU-Aware Callbacks
**GPU Additions:**
- Updated `TestAccuracyTracker` callback to use GPU device context
- Evaluation during training happens on GPU

**Key Features:**
- Test accuracy tracking optimized for GPU
- Maintains all plotting and visualization functionality
- Seamless GPU/CPU switching

### 7. **config.py** - NEW Configuration File
**Added:**
- Central configuration file with all training parameters
- Resolves missing import: `from config import *`

**Contents:**
- DATA_DIR, MODEL_DIR paths
- Training hyperparameters (EPOCHS, SEQUENCE_LENGTH, BATCH_SIZE, NUM_CLASSES)
- RANDOM_SEED for reproducibility
- USE_AUGMENTATION flag

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **All changes are backward compatible:**
- Existing logic and pipelines remain unchanged
- Code automatically detects GPU availability
- Falls back to CPU gracefully if no GPU detected
- All data processing functions work identically
- Model architectures are preserved
- Training results will be numerically identical (with minor floating-point differences due to GPU computation order)

## GPU Features Implemented

1. **Automatic GPU Detection**: Detects available GPUs at runtime
2. **Memory Growth**: Prevents OOM errors by enabling gradual GPU memory allocation
3. **Device Placement**: Wraps computationally intensive operations with GPU context
4. **Dataset Optimization**: Optional GPU-optimized dataset pipeline with prefetching
5. **Graceful Fallback**: Automatically uses CPU if GPU unavailable

## Performance Improvements Expected

- **Training Speed**: 5-50x faster depending on GPU hardware
- **Data Loading**: Faster batch preparation with `tf.data.AUTOTUNE`
- **Memory Efficiency**: Gradual memory allocation prevents crashes
- **Model Evaluation**: GPU-accelerated inference

## Usage

Simply run the existing scripts as normal:
```bash
python train.py
```

The GPU will be automatically used if available, otherwise CPU will be used transparently.

## No Breaking Changes

✅ Function signatures unchanged
✅ Model architectures unchanged
✅ Data pipeline unchanged
✅ Training logic unchanged
✅ Output formats unchanged
✅ Configuration variables unchanged (added to config.py)
